## Khan Academy Extension
### [Install on Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-khan-academy-extensio/gniggljddhajnfbkjndcgnomkddfcial)

Khan Academy Extension is a chrome extension for the computing section of [khanacademy](https://khanacademy.org). 


It is actively developed by [Jett Burns](https://github.com/jettburns14), [Ethan Luis McDonough](https://github.com/EthanLuisMcDonough), and [Luke Krikorian](https://github.com/lukekrikorian).
We are currently rewriting it in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Any PRs to the [old extension](https://github.com/ka-extension/ka-extension/) will probably be ignored.

### Contributing
